# Zomato Restaurants Expansion Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using spreadsheet)
## Project Objective
To analyze Zomatoâ€™s global restaurant dataset to uncover patterns in geographic expansion, customer engagement, and service availability. The project aims to identify high-growth markets, assess service penetration (such as table booking and online delivery), and recommend strategic areas for future expansion based on data-driven insights.


## Questions(KPIs)
-  What is the total no. of tables present in the data?
-  What is the total no. of attributes present in the data?
- How many categorical columns are there in the data? 
- The data consists of some inconsistent and missing values so ensure that the data used for further analysis is cleaned.
- Using the LookUp functions, fill up the countries in the original data using the country code.
-Create a table to represent the number of restaurants opened in each country.

## Project Insights
-INDIA accounts for over 90.59% of global table bookings,indicating a mature market with saturated user engagement.      
-Low feature penetrating(<5%) across all other countries highlights feature underutilization.
-USA(4.54%) and UK(0.84%) demonstrate early signs of feature traction,making them prime candidates for localized feature scaling.
-Markets like Canada(0.04%) & Australia(0.25%)  reflect either a lack of promotion or market misfit.
-Uniform booking percentages like Qatar,Sri Lanka &Singapore(each 0.21%) point to low user adoption   likely due to limited visibility.
-Low market penetration in emerging region like Indonesia(0.22%) & the Phillipines  present first-mover advantage. 
-Sril Lanka with an average cost of ~2,375,suggest high-end dining options With 35,350 as the total average cost just across 22 restaurants,indicates a market with fewer but likely upscale or premium-prices        restaurants.
-South Africa has the largest restaurant network(60),despite this average cost per restaurant(~419.73)  is moderate.
-Canada has the lowest total average cost(145) & the lowest average cost per restaurant(~36.25).
-Qatar(~223.75) & Turkey(~84.85)  fall in mid-range for average cost per restaurant,suggesting moderately priced dining options.
-With (40) restaurant & an average cost of(~69.75) per restaurant New Zealand reflects a balanced dining scene.


##CONCLUSION
-Market Penetration  across various countries like South Africa & New Zealand show high restaurant counts,indicating broad market presence.
-User Engagement Trends differ across various regions even if they are in Tier 1 cities.
-Customer Behaviour is region-specific varying average costs indicate value perception & dining preference.
