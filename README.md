## Project Objective

## Questions(KPIs)
-  What is the total no. of tables present in the data?
-  What is the total no. of attributes present in the data?
- How many categorical columns are there in the data? 
- The data consists of some inconsistent and missing values so ensure that the data used for further analysis is cleaned.
- Using the LookUp functions, fill up the countries in the original data using the country code.
-Create a table to represent the number of restaurants opened in each country.
-Also, the management wants to look at the number of restaurants opened each year, so provide them with something here.
-What is the total number of restaurants in India in the price range of 4? 
-What is the average number of voters for the restaurants in each country according to the data?
-Calculate the average rating for all the restaurants that have price_range < 4 and provide online delivery. Use only the “IF” function, Logical Operators, and Aggregation functions to solve this problem. 
-Using Conditional formatting highlight the rows of restaurants that are located in the countries or cities that you’ve suggested to the management for opening new restaurants. 
-Create a new customized price column that consists of the abbreviation/symbol of the currency along with the Average_cost_for_two value.
