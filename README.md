## Questions(KPIs)
-  What is the total no. of tables present in the data?
-  What is the total no. of attributes present in the data?
- How many categorical columns are there in the data? 
- The data consists of some inconsistent and missing values so ensure that the data used for further analysis is cleaned.
- Using the LookUp functions, fill up the countries in the original data using the country code.
-Create a table to represent the number of restaurants opened in each country.

## Project Insights
-INDIA accounts for over 90.59% of global table bookings,indicating a mature market with saturated user engagement.      
-Low feature penetrating(<5%) across all other countries highlights feature underutilization.
-USA(4.54%) and UK(0.84%) demonstrate early signs of feature traction,making them prime candidates for localized feature scaling.
-Markets like Canada(0.04%) & Australia(0.25%)  reflect either a lack of promotion or market misfit.
-Uniform booking percentages like Qatar,Sri Lanka &Singapore(each 0.21%) point to low user adoption   likely due to limited visibility.

##CONCLUSION
-Market Penetration  across various countries like South Africa & New Zealand show high restaurant counts,indicating broad market presence.
-User Engagement Trends differ across various regions even if they are in Tier 1 cities.
-Customer Behaviour is region-specific varying average costs indicate value perception & dining preference.
